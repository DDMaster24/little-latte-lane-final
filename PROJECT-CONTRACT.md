## IN PROGRESS

### Google Play Store Deployment - FIXES APPLIED
**Status:** Configuration fixed, ready for AAB rebuild

**Root Cause Identified:**
- ❌ Previous issue: Capacitor config had `cleartext: true` causing security violations
- ❌ Previous issue: Missing network security configuration
- ❌ Previous issue: Improper redirect handling from live URL

**Fixes Applied (October 21, 2025):**
1. ✅ Updated `capacitor.config.ts` with proper HTTPS-only configuration
2. ✅ Created `network_security_config.xml` for Android security compliance
3. ✅ Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` with network security config
4. ✅ Created minimal `www/index.html` with proper redirect logic
5. ✅ Synced Capacitor with Android project successfully
6. ✅ Disabled PWA in Next.js config (conflicts with native app)
7. ✅ Restored server-side rendering (API routes required)

**Configuration Summary:**
- App points to live backend: `https://www.littlelattelane.co.za`
- HTTPS enforced (no cleartext traffic)
- Network security config whitelists: littlelattelane.co.za, supabase.co
- Capacitor successfully synced with Android project

**Progress Timeline:**
- ✅ Changed developer account from personal to organizational
- ✅ Requested and received DUNS number for organization verification
- ✅ Recreated application under organizational account (compliance with Google Play policies)
- ✅ Completed all dashboard checklists
- ✅ Generated and uploaded AAB file successfully (previous version)
- ✅ Started internal testing phase
- ✅ Sent test invitations to 3 email addresses (developer + 2 family members)
- ✅ Test users successfully received links and downloaded app
- ❌ **PREVIOUS ISSUE FIXED:** App was crashing due to cleartext traffic and security config
- ✅ **CONFIGURATION FIXED:** Ready to build new AAB file

**Next Steps:**
1. Build signed AAB file in Android Studio (Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK)
2. Upload new AAB to Google Play Console (Internal Testing track)
3. Test on 3 devices again
4. If successful, promote to production track

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before Starting Work
1. Read this contract to understand current status
2. Validate work aligns with pending tasks
3. Use live Supabase connection for database verification
4. Make changes systematically (one feature at a time)
5. Test thoroughly before committing

### Database Changes
- Use live Supabase connection (never static files)
- Generate types after schema changes: `supabase gen types typescript --project-id awytuszmunxvthuizyur > src/types/supabase.ts`
- Test on live database immediately

### Deployment
- Push to main branch triggers automatic Vercel deployment
- No manual deployment needed

### Quality Checks
```powershell
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript validation
npm run lint:fix     # ESLint auto-fix
npm run build        # Production build test
```
