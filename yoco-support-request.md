## Subject: Webhook Setup Request for Little Latte Lane

Hello Yoco Support Team,

I'm setting up webhook notifications for my restaurant "Little Latte Lane" and need assistance with webhook registration.

**Account Details:**
- Business: Little Latte Lane
- Website: https://www.littlelattelane.co.za
- Current API Keys: Test mode (pk_test_97c6b771z6ZX..., sk_test_021f32a3zapZ...)

**What I Need:**
1. Register a webhook for payment notifications
2. Webhook URL: https://www.littlelattelane.co.za/api/yoco/webhook
3. Event Type: payment.created
4. Webhook Name: Little Latte Lane Payment Webhook

**Issue:**
- I can process payments successfully with my API keys
- However, webhook creation returns 401 Unauthorized
- I've tried both API calls and the Developer Hub portal

**Request:**
Could you please:
1. Enable webhook permissions for my account, OR
2. Register this webhook manually for me, OR  
3. Provide API keys with webhook creation permissions

**Why I Need This:**
- To automatically update order status when payments complete
- To provide better customer experience with real-time updates
- To reduce manual order management

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Little Latte Lane
